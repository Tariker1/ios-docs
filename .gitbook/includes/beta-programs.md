## What's a Beta Program?

Luciq's Beta Programs provide early access to specific features, letting you explore new features and influence their final design with your feedback.

* **Influence Development**: Your feedback shapes the final product.
* **Collaborate with Us**: Drive meaningful improvements that impact your team.

## What to expect from Beta Features?

Beta features are still evolving, which means:

* Minor bugs or areas needing improvement might exist.
* Some features may be experimental and require feedback for further development.

**Your Role:**

* Test the feature.
* Share your feedback to help us tailor it to your needs.

We’ll keep you updated on changes and improvements based on your insights!

## Finding and Joining Beta Features

Beta features are marked with a **Beta** label in the dashboard, such as on the navigation bar or other entry points.

**How to join?**
