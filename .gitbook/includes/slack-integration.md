Integrating Luciq with Slack is really simple. With a few clicks, you can be notified on Slack whenever you receive a new bug, feedback, crash or user reply.

{% step %}
### Click Authorize Slack

Click on _Authorize Slack_ to allow the integration between both Slack and Luciq. You will be redirected to Slack's authentication page.
