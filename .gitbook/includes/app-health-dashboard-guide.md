### Frustration-Free Sessions and Crash-Free Sessions Over Time

This graph shows the trend of your app's frustration-free sessions and crash-free sessions over a selected period. The provided graph shows fluctuations in frustration-free sessions over a 28-day period, helping in identifying patterns and periods of performance degradation or improvement. You can click and drag on the graph to zoom in and the whole page will reflect the data of the new time range.

### App Insights

This section provides detailed metrics on various aspects of your app’s performance, highlighted with red, yellow, and green indicators to show their status as well as a change rate calculated by comparing the current time period to the previous time period. So for example if you’re seeing data for the past 28 days, the change is calculated by comparing to the 28 days before that.

* **Crash-Free Sessions**: Percentage of sessions without crashes.
* **Crash-Free Users**: Percentage of users who did not experience crashes.
* **OOMs**: Percentage of sessions without Out-Of-Memory errors.
* **ANRs**: Percentage of sessions without Application not Responding errors.
* **Cold App Launch**: Apdex score of the app when launched from a cold state based on its latency.
* **Network**: Network apdex score, calculated based on the performance of key network calls.
* **Screen Loading**: Apdex score of screen loading times.
* **UI Hangs**: Apdex score measuring the times your app faces UI hangs which is when the app isn't responding to the user's input for more than 250 ms.
* **App Hangs**: Percentage of sessions without App hangs which is when an app is unresponsive or more than 3 seconds.
* **Non-Fatals**: Number of non fatals reported.
* **Bugs**: Number of bugs reported.

## Best Practices

The App Health Dashboard is a powerful tool for developers to monitor, analyze, and improve the performance and user experience of their application. Here are the best practices for utilizing this dashboard effectively:

1. **Regular Monitoring**
   * **Daily Check-Ins**: Make it a habit to review the dashboard daily to quickly catch any emerging issues.
   * **Focus on Key Metrics**: Pay particular attention to the Overall Frustration-Free Sessions and the Crash-Free Sessions metrics to ensure your app is meeting performance standards.
2. **Analyzing Trends Over Time**
   * **Utilize the Graphs**: Use the "Frustration-Free Sessions and Crash-Free Sessions Over Time" graph to identify patterns or recurring issues. Look for dips in performance or spikes in crashes that correlate with specific timeframes or events (e.g., new releases).
   * **Historical Comparison**: Compare current performance metrics with historical data to understand how recent changes impact app stability and performance.
3. **Deep Dive into App Insights**
   * **Prioritize Red Metrics**: Focus on metrics highlighted in red in the "App Insights" section as they indicate critical issues needing immediate attention.
     * For example, if the “Cold App Launch” Apdex drops, click on it to navigate to the the “Cold App Launch” page to analyze it more.
   * **Continuous Improvement**: Aim to turn yellow metrics to green by systematically addressing the underlying issues.
