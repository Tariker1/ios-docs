## [Zendesk](https://luciq.ai/integrations/zendesk)

We know that you care about your customers' engagement a lot. If you are using Zendesk to handle the process, you can forward all your crash reports, bug reports and chats to your Zendesk account.

Normally when you reply to your users through Zendesk, they receive your replies as emails. The best thing about linking your Luciq account with your Zendesk account is that your **users will receive your replies as emails and in-app as well**.\
You can reply to your users either from your Luciq dashboard or your Zendesk account and in both cases, they will see your replies within your application.
