# Overview

The new Luciq integration with Grafana enables end-to-end tracing for network calls, connecting client-side and server-side monitoring for your network requests. By using a unique trace ID, you can follow any network request from the client to the server, providing insights for troubleshooting networking issues.

# Prerequisites

* **Backend**
  * **Agent Supporting W3C Context Propagation:** Ensure your backend agent supports W3C context propagation.

{% hint style="info" %}
## **Note**

If you use any trace sampling algorithms, Grafana may drop some traces. Consequently, you might see network requests in Luciq that are not available in Grafana.
{% endhint %}

* **Luciq's Side**
  * **Supported Platforms**: This integration is only supported for iOS and Android.
  * **Luciq SDK Version**: Ensure you have Luciq SDK version 13.2.0 or higher for both iOS and Android.
  * If you are manually logging the network they need to:
    * Either send the `httpUrlConnection` or make sure you send all headers in the request
    * If you are masking the headers, make sure you don't remove the `traceparent` header

## Integration Steps

{% hint style="info" %}
By setting up this integration, Luciq will attach a trace ID as an HTTP header to your network requests. This allows us to link network requests from Luciq to Grafana.
{% endhint %}

* To create a Grafana Integration go to Settings -> Integrations -> Grafana in your Luciq dashboard.

1.  **Setup**

* Enter the link to **the Grafana dashboard with the network traces** to link to Luciq.
* Create a `traceID` variable in that Grafana dashboard, and **ensure the URL includes the** `traceID` **variable key at the end**.
* For example:\
  `https://organization.grafana.net/d/<dashboard-id>/your-traces-dashboard?orgId=1&var-traceid=`
* For self-hosted Grafana, contact [support@Luciq.com](mailto:support@Luciq.com) to whitelist your domain.

2. **Test**:

*   Validate the Grafana dashboard link to ensure it is correct.

3. **Finish**:

* Ensure the APM - Network Requests checkbox is checked to trace network requests to Grafana.
*   Give your integration a name and save the integration.

# Using the Integration

When a network occurrence is logged, a unique trace ID will appear on the occurrence page in the Luciq dashboard.

1. Navigate to a network occurrence in Luciq.
2.  Click on **View on Grafana** to verify that it redirects you to the correct Grafana dashboard, filtered by the `TraceID`.
