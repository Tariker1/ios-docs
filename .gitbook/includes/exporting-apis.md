## Exporting App Health Metrics via API

To help teams unify their observability and performance workflows, Luciq offers API access to export app health metrics—including crash-free sessions, cold and hot app launches, OOMs, ANRs, and more. This enables you to integrate Luciq insights into your preferred monitoring tools such as **Grafana**, **Datadog**, or internal dashboards.
