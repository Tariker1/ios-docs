> ### Integrating Luciq
>
> To be able to use Luciq's In-App Surveys product, you must first [integrate the SDK](https://docs.luciq.ai/ios-integration).

The best and most effective way to collect data about your application and evaluate it is by directly asking the people who are using it. Feedback from your actual users will help answer a lot of questions and guide you to make decisions. The good thing is, setting up these in-app surveys from your dashboard, controlling them in your app, and accessing their results can be done easily.

Below is the breakdown of Luciq's Surveys & Announcements:

1.[**Creating Surveys**](https://docs.luciq.ai/ios-creating-surveys)\
Learn how to create a new survey or announcement as well as what the different types of templates are from this section.

2.[**Targeting Surveys**](https://docs.luciq.ai/ios-targeting-surveys)\
Different users need different surveys. Learn how to show specific surveys to specific users at just the right time in this section.

3.[**Customizing Survey Behavior**](https://docs.luciq.ai/ios-customizing-survey-behavior)\
Check out how to show a welcome screen prior to a user seeing the survey and learn why certain users will be unable to see new surveys.

4.[**Reply to Survey Responders**](https://docs.luciq.ai/ios-reply-to-survey-responders)\
In this section, you can find instructions for how to reply to any survey response in order to communicate with the responder.

5.[**Event Handlers**](https://docs.luciq.ai/ios-in-app-surveys-event-handlers)\
If you wish to have any blocks of code run when a survey is dismissed, this section details just how you can do that.

6.[**Disabling/Enabling In-App Surveys**](https://docs.luciq.ai/ios-disabling-enabling-in-app-surveys)\
Surveys might not be your thing and that's okay. This section stops surveys from appearing in your application.
