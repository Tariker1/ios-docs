## What is Frustration Impact?

Frustration Impact helps you understand how much each issue in your app contributes to frustrating sessions, affecting both your **Frustration score** and **issue prioritization**. This calculation ensures that the issues causing the most user frustration are ranked higher in the **Issues List**, helping you focus on what matters most.

## Frustration Impact Levels

To better understand the significance of each issue based on its Frustration Impact, issues are classified into the following categories:

* **High Impact:** Issues affecting ≥0.5% of total sessions. These are critical and require immediate attention.
* **Medium Impact:** Issues affecting between 0.01% and 0.5% of sessions. These should be addressed after high-impact issues.
* **Low Impact:** Issues affecting <0.01% of sessions. These have minimal impact but may still need resolution over time.
* **No Impact:** Issues that don’t affect your frustration-free sessions score, including:
  * APM groups where all occurrences are satisfying (Frustration-Free Sessions 1).
  * Metrics marked as non-key by your team.

## How is Frustration Impact Calculated?

The Frustration Impact of an issue reflects its effect on your app's frustration-free sessions by estimating the **percentage of frustrating or tolerable sessions it causes.**

### For performance issues:

**Example 1: Cold App Launch**

We approximate the percentage of sessions that were **frustrating** or **tolerable** due to the **cold app launch**. We calculate this by considering how bad the **cold app launch** is within all app launches, and **how much app launches contribute to frustrating and tolerable sessions** in total.

**Example 2: Network Requests**

We approximate the percentage of sessions that were **frustrating** or **tolerable** due to this particular **network request**. We calculate this by considering **how bad the network request is** within all networks, and **how much networks are contributing to frustrating and tolerable sessions** in total.

**Example 3: App Hangs**

**Notes:**

* This calculation applies to **app launch**, **networks**, **screen loading**, **flows**, **UI hangs**, **app hangs**, and **force restarts**.
* When calculating **Frustrating/Tolerable Sessions Caused by an issue, tolerable sessions** are given **half the weight** compared to **frustrating sessions**.
* **Dissat count** = (number of frustrating occurrences) + 0.5 \* (number of tolerable occurrences)

### For Crashes:

A crash occurrence disrupts the user session completely. So we simply calculate the percentage of sessions this crash impacted.

**Notes:**

* This calculation applies to fatal crashes, ANRs for Android, and OOMs for iOS.
