The Team Dashboard page helps track and improve your team’s ownership of screens by monitoring performance and stability metrics like app launch time, loading speed, UI hangs, and crashes. It allows leaders to identify and address issues affecting their team's areas, ensuring alignment with overall app performance goals.
