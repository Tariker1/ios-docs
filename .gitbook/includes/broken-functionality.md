title: Broken Functionality
---

## Overview

**AI Broken Functionality** is a feature built on top of Session Replay. Once enabled, it identifies issues in your app’s functionality that affect user experience, such as:

* Buttons or links that don’t respond
* Forms that fail to submit
* Flows that break mid-process
* Unexpected crashes or error messages
* Inconsistent app behavior compared to expected flows

Detected problems are surfaced as **Broken Functionality** events, which can be reviewed alongside normal session data.

## How to Use

You need to have the **Session Replay** product enabled to be able to enable the AI Broken Functionality feature. Once the feature is enabled, you follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step

1.  On the Session Replay list, use the new “AI Issues” filter to only show sessions flagged with AI issues including broken functionality.

2.  Open a session with flagged issues. Two ways to navigate:

    * Scroll through the event timeline to find the broken functionality event.
    * Click the purple dot on the timeline to jump directly to the issue’s screenshot view.
    * Use the new AI issues filter, you can select “Broken Functionality”

3. Viewing a Broken Functionality event shows:
   * The exact screenshot where the issue was detected
   * A descriptive summary of the issue (e.g. “Subtotal is miscalculated”)

## How It Works

* No instrumentation changes required - once enabled, existing session screenshots, user flow and app behavior are routed to broken functionality analysis pipeline.
* Screenshots, user flow and app behavior data are passed through an AI model for analysis.
* When functional breakdowns that didn’t result in crashes or performance issues are detected, a Broken functionality event is emitted in the timeline at the same timestamp as the screenshot.
* The event payload includes descriptive text of the breakdown.
* On the front end, UI surfaces let you filter and inspect these events alongside other session data.
