# What is an Extended Bug Report?

Free-form comments from reporters can be time-consuming to read through when triaging bugs. The Extended Bug Report standardizes all of your bug reports with additional fields that are commonly used by QA and technical beta testers: steps to reproduce the bug, actual results, and expected results.
