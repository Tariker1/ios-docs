## [GitHub](https://luciq.ai/integrations/github)

Manage your projects and issues right inside GitHub by following these simple steps.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
## Select the Organization

Select the Organization you would like to forward to. If it's not in the drop-down list, you can select _Add more organizations_ to open GitHub and add your Organization.

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
## Choose repository and assignee

You will be redirected back to Luciq to complete the setup. Now you only have to choose the repository and assignee for the forwarded issues. You can also choose which details get forwarded as well.

## Test the integration

At this point, we just need to test your integration so that we're sure everything is working smoothly.

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
## Complete setup

All done! Your integration is now set up and ready to go. From this final page, you can allow automatic forwarding (don't worry though, this can be reconfigured at any time!)
