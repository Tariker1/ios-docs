### Important Notice

Luciq has officially deprecated its self-serve pricing plans. This change is based on our belief that customers get the most out of Luciq when they’re at a stage where stability and performance are critical for their growth.

This change means:

* Self-serve pricing plans are no longer available for new sign-ups.
* Existing self-serve customers can only upgrade to an Enterprise plan.
* Downgrades or switching between self-serve plans are not supported.

This shift allows us to focus on building deeper partnerships and providing a more tailored experience for organizations with complex needs and at scale. For more details view our [FAQs](https://docs.luciq.ai/docs/enterprise-plan#self-serve-plan-deprecation-faqs).

## Enterprise Features

### Improved Data Retention

Any data you receive on your dashboard (such as bug reports, crash reports, APM events, chats, etc.) can be retained for a period that matches your needs and is not deleted unless you request the data to be removed.

### Bigger Sessions Support

Your applications will not be restricted to the monthly sessions available on other plans and you will be able to customize the session limit to your needs. You can find out more about how we calculate sessions [here](https://docs.luciq.ai/docs/enterprise-plan#section-session-calculation).

### SDK Customizations

Need specific customizations or features in the SDK? We'll customize the SDK design and functionality to fit with your users, style guide, and team.

### Account Management

A dedicated Luciq team member will be responsible for conducting regular health checks, advising you on industry best practices, and helping you achieve your goals.

### Dedicated Hosting

We'll manage a private cloud for you so you can have a single-tenant environment.

### Custom Integrations

We can build you new integrations or customize existing third-party integrations with any of our tools.

### White Labeling

Use the Luciq SDK fully logo-free and without the "Powered by Luciq" message.

## Enterprise Plan Pricing

Our Enterprise plan is completely customized depending on your needs of features stated on our pricing page, with an annual commitment deal for the Standard plan.

### Session Calculation

{% hint style="info" %}
### Definition Change

The below definition of sessions is implemented for any new plan created starting the 27th of June, 2022.
{% endhint %}

A session represents a single period of user interaction with your app. Sessions serve as useful containers of measured activity, which includes screen views, events, etc.

A session is the period of time a user has your app in the foreground. It begins when the app is brought into the foreground and a session will end when the app goes into the background. At the end of each session, we sync the session details with your dashboard so that the users, user attributes, and events are up to date. _Consecutive sessions within 30 minutes are still counted as the same session._ Previously, consecutive sessions were counted as different sessions.
