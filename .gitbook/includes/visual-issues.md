title: Visual Issues
---

## Overview

**AI Visual Issues** is a feature built on top of Session Replay. Once enabled, it uses AI to scan screenshots captured during user sessions and flag visual defects such as:

* Misaligned elements or overlapping UI
* Color variations that don’t match design spec
* Unexpected layout shifts or gaps
* Text overflow, clipping, or truncation
* Visual artifacts, noise, or anomalies

These issues get surfaced as **Visual Issue events**, which you can filter and inspect alongside normal session data.

## How to Use

You need to have the **Session Replay** product enabled to be able to enable the AI Visual Issues feature. Once the feature is enabled, you follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step

1.  On the Session Replay list, use the new “AI Issues” filter to only show sessions flagged with AI issues including visual issues.

2.  Open a session with flagged issues. Two ways to navigate:

    * Scroll through the event timeline to find the visual issue event.
    * Click the purple dot on the timeline to jump directly to the issue’s screenshot view.
    * Use the new AI issues filter, you can select “Visual Issues”

3. Viewing a Visual Issue event shows:
   * The exact screenshot where the issue was detected
   * A descriptive summary of the issue (e.g. “element misaligned by 4px”)

## How It Works

* No instrumentation changes required - once enabled, existing session screenshots are routed to the visual analysis pipeline.
* Screenshots are passed through an AI model for analysis.
* When anomalies are detected, a Visual Issue event is emitted in the timeline at the same timestamp as the screenshot.
* The event payload includes descriptive text of the anomaly
* On the front end, UI surfaces let you filter and inspect these events alongside other session data.
