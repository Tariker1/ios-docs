Luciq helps you automate the entire rollout process, as well as extra automation capabilities that you can utilize to save time and eliminate a handful of manual tasks.

**Workflow Automation Examples**:

* Keep your team updated with the status of the rollout.
* Create alerts to get your team notified about any updates.
* Triage and manage your rollout without the need to use multiple tools.

## Create your rules

To get started with rollout management workflow automation, hover the the left navigation menu and click on “Alerts & Rules”

You can view a list of all created rules or performance metrics, use the filters to view only rules for bugs, crashes, performance metrics or release rollout, and click on “Create” to get started.

## Rollout Management Alert

Select “Release Rollout” from the dropdown menu under the “For”.

### Triggers

Then you need to select a trigger; below is a list of all available triggers:

* **Health Metrics**:
  * _**Apdex**_: Halt/Pause or Release the Rollout process based on your application's apdex score within a period of time for a specific or all app versions.
  * _**Crash-Free Sessions**_: Halt/Pause or Release the Rollout process based on the Crash-Free percentage within a period of time for a specific or all app versions.
* **Rollout Progress**:
  * _**Rollout Status Change**_: Get notified whenever the rollout status is changed for a specific or all app versions.
  * _**Rollout Percentage Change**_: Get notified whenever the rollout percentage is changed for a specific or all app versions.
  * _**Daily Rollout Summary**_: Get notified if the daily rollout summary is changed for a specific or all app versions.

### Conditions

After selecting the trigger, you can select a set of conditions that need to be met for the rule to be triggered.

**Below is a list of all available conditions**:

* _**Version Adoption Percentage**_: Check if the version adoption percentage is greater or less than a specified percentage.
* _**Version Rollout Percentage**_: Check if the version rollout percentage is greater or less than a specified percentage.
* _**Rollout Status**_: The status of the rollout is one of the following: Started, Halted/Paused, Resumed, or Completed.

You can add as many conditions as you see fit. You can also choose to “AND” or “OR” the selected conditions.

### Alerting channels

The last thing you need to do is specify the actions you want to automate using this rule. There are various actions available:

* _**Change status to**_: Change the status of the rollout to one of Halt/Pause & Release to All.
* _**Send email to**_: Send an email to a dashboard member(s).
* _**Forward it to**_: Get notified on Slack if you have an integration set up on your dashboard.

## Use Cases

Now let's discover different scenarios for workflow automation that help track your app's health, like Apdex and Crash-Free Sessions, if they reach a specific threshold to get notified and how you can use the rules to achieve this:

_**Scenario A**_:

You have a version being rolled out to your users, and if you're worried it might cause crashes, you can set up an automation that would automatically pause the rollout if the crash-free sessions rate falls below 97% in a 24-hour window to stop the issue from affecting any other customers while you work on a fix.

_**Scenario B**_:\
You can set an automation that keeps track of the crash-free sessions for your application, and if a release is performing as well as you expect (e.g., not facing any crashes), you can automatically have it released to all users to quickly increase its adoption.

_**Scenario C**_:

You can stay up to date whenever the rollout status changes to either Started, Halted / Paused, Resumed, or Completed. This can be done by setting up a Slack integration and getting notified on your preferred channel.

_**Scenario D**_:

You can get a daily update on your release rollout health and progress by sending an e-mail to all team members who are on the dashboard or a selection of them upon your preference.
