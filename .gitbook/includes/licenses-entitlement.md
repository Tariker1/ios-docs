### 1) What You Are Buying?

This section summarizes what your license includes and how usage is measured. As part of your license, you purchase a **range of daily active users (DAU)** for any of the following products:

1. Bug Reporting
2. Crash Reporting
3. Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
4. Session Replay
5. Surveys
6. Rollout management
7. App Ratings and Reviews

### 2) DAU Definitions and Session Entitlements

Here’s how we define and measure usage across users and sessions, and how that translates into your entitlements.

### How we calculate DAU?

* **Pre-purchase:** We use third-party app-store analytics (e.g., Sensor Tower) to estimate your DAU and determine the appropriate range.
* **Post-onboarding:** We use Luciq SDK telemetry from your app to measure your actual DAU.

### Session Entitlement

For every 1 DAU you are entitled to **180 Sessions per month**.

### 3) Role Types: Who Can Do What

This section outlines the access levels available for team members within your account.
