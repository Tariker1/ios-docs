## Connect your AI IDE directly to Luciq’s mobile observability data.

The **Luciq MCP (Model Context Protocol) Serve**r provides a standardized, secure interface that allows any compatible AI model or IDE, such as Cursor, Claude Code, or VS Code MCP clients, to access **crash data, analytics, and debugging insights** from Luciq.

Use natural language to query and explore your app’s health directly inside your IDE:

> “List my Android apps”\
> “Show me production crashes from the last week”\
> “Get crash #42 details”

***

## Overview

Luciq MCP follows the **authenticated remote** [MCP spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26), enabling AI-native tools to connect safely to your workspace.

The server exposes tools for:

* Listing applications
* Fetching crash reports
* Retrieving detailed crash traces
* Discovering crash patterns

### What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol ([MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro)) is an open standard introduced by Anthropic. It defines a secure, language-agnostic way for AI tools (like Claude or Cursor) to connect to external data sources and APIs.

In simple terms: MCP allows your AI IDE to “talk to Luciq”, requesting crash logs, analytics, or version data directly from your app’s workspace, using standardized JSON-RPC calls.

Luciq’s MCP Server brings this capability to **mobile observability**, making it the first MCP integration designed specifically for **mobile debugging and release management.**

### Why MCP?

* **Standardized Interface**. Works natively across all MCP-compatible IDEs
* **AI-Ready**. Lets LLM-powered assistants reason over Luciq data.
* **Simple Integration**. One configuration file, no SDKs required.
* **Secure by Design**. Token-based access scoped to your workspace
