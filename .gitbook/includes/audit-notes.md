Audit Notes are valuable detailed logs of any action performed on the dashboard by any team member. Only dashboard owners and administrators have visibility over them. The displayed logs show data about the team member, the action they performed, their IP address, the date, and the timestamp to help you track down all the activities performed on your Luciq dashboard to ensure data integrity and address any security concerns!
