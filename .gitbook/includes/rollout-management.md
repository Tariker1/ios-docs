This feature allows you to monitor release rollout progress & manage it during the staged rollout phase. Integrating your application with the App Store is a prerequisite to rollout management with its guide [here](../../product-guides/integrations/store-integrations.md).

## Overview

With the App Store integrated with the dashboard, you can view the In-Progress/Paused releases highlighted with progress percentage on your Releases page.

### Rollout Progress

On the Releases details page, you'll be able to view the progress of the rollout in addition to the rollout start date. This phased release allows you to release the app version over seven days to users who have enabled automatic updates.
