# Getting Started

Welcome to the Luciq Docs, where you can find all the resources you need to start debugging faster and building better apps. Luciq includes capabilities for Bug Reporting, Crash Reporting, and App Performance Monitoring.

Navigate the docs using the sidebar on the left-hand side to jump to any functionality or specific API that you're looking for. All the API methods that can be used in the SDK can be found in these sections with explanations about what they do and how to use them.

You can also find information in these docs about the data found in [your dashboard](https://demo-dashboard.luciq.ai/applications/ios-demo-app/production/app-health?filters=%7B%22date_ms%22:%7B%22gte%22:1758240000000,%22lte%22:1758844799999,%22shortcutLabel%22:%22Last%207%20days%22%7D,%22app_version%22:%22top_releases%22%7D).
