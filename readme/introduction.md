# Introduction

Luciq SDK aims to save developers time. We believe that you should spend your time creating awesome features and improving your application instead of chasing information from your testers and users. We believe that spending hours and hours debugging to locate the source of a problem is a waste of time.

This can be done through our main products for Flutter apps:

1. **Bug Reporting**
2. **Crash Reporting**
3. **App Performance Monitoring**
4. **Session Replay**
5. **In-App Replies**
6. **In-App Surveys**
7. **Feature Requests**
