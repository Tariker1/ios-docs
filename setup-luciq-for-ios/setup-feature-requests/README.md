# Setup Feature Requests

Allowing users to suggest new features can be very beneficial for the growth of your application. You can use Instabug Feature Requests to enable your users to submit new feature ideas, vote and comment on other requests, and see the status of each submitted idea right inside your app.

From your dashboard, you can moderate these requests, update their status, as well as interact with your users to ask for more details or keep them up-to-date about upcoming releases.
