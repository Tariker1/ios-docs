# SDK Customization

After integrating the Luciq SDK into your application, you will automatically be collecting data in the background of your app. This is done for accurate crash reporting, User Steps, Network Logs, View Hierarchy, Session Profiler, and other useful features that help you investigate bugs and improve the quality of your app.

However, you'll need to gather other information that requires input from your app users, such as for bug reporting, in-app surveys, and feature requests.

To make your users' experience as simple and seamless as possible, you can customize the colors of all Luciq screens, change the language, modify the messages and text that appear, change the invocation events, as well as control which popup should appear to your users and when.

The SDK Customizations section of the Luciq docs is divided as follows:

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th align="center"></th><th></th><th data-hidden data-card-target data-type="content-ref"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><a href="welcome-message.md">Welcome Message</a></td><td>On-board your users and teach them how to reach you using Luciq for either beta testers or live users.</td><td><a href="welcome-message.md">welcome-message.md</a></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><a href="prompt-options.md">Prompt Options</a></td><td>Learn how to control the default menu that pops up when Luciq is invoked in your app.</td><td><a href="prompt-options.md">prompt-options.md</a></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><a href="ui-color-and-theme.md">UI Color &#x26; Theme</a></td><td>Customize the SDK to match your app's design and brand palette.</td><td><a href="ui-color-and-theme.md">ui-color-and-theme.md</a></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><a href="sdk-locale.md">SDK Locale</a></td><td><p>Change the language of the SDK as well as the content of all the messages that your users see.</p><p><br></p></td><td><a href="sdk-locale.md">sdk-locale.md</a></td></tr></tbody></table>
