# Accessibility

Our Bug Reporting and Surveys screens are designed to allow easier interaction for users with disabilities. With our accessibility feature, you will ensure every user can complete a survey, submit a bug, or ask a question!

In order to enable accessibility options, you'll need to do the following:

1. Navigate to iPhone settings.
2. Accessibility
3. Voice-over

The accessibility feature supported on iOS is VoiceOver. You can check [this ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accessibility/supporting_voiceover_in_your_app/#3017300)link for more details.
